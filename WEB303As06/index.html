                  Amitabh Bachchan (born on 11 October 1942) is an Indian actor, film producer, television host, 
                  occasional playback singer and former politician, who works in Hindi cinema. In a film career spanning over five decades, he 
                  has starred in more than 200 films. Bachchan is widely regarded as one of the most successful and influential actors in the 
                  history of Indian cinema. He is referred to as the Shahenshah of Bollywood, Sadi Ke Mahanayak (Hindi for, "Greatest actor of the century"), 
                  Star of the Millennium, or Big B. His dominance in the Indian movie scenario during the 1970s–80s made the French director François Truffaut 
                  call it a "one-man industry"

                    Bachchan made his film debut in 1969, as a voice narrator in Mrinal Sen's National Award-winning film Bhuvan Shome. 
                    His first acting role was as one of the seven protagonists in the film Saat Hindustani, directed by Khwaja Ahmad Abbas and 
                    featuring Utpal Dutt, Anwar Ali (brother of comedian Mehmood), Madhu and Jalal Agha.

                    Anand (1971) followed, in which Bachchan starred alongside Rajesh Khanna. His role as a doctor with a cynical view of life 
                    garnered Bachchan his first Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor. He then played his first antagonist role as an 
                    infatuated lover-turned-murderer in Parwana (1971). Following Parwana were several films including Reshma Aur Shera (1971). 
                    During this time, he made a guest appearance in the film Guddi which starred his future wife Jaya Bhaduri. He narrated part 
                    of the film Bawarchi. In 1972, he made an appearance in the road action comedy Bombay to Goa directed by S. Ramanathan which 
                    was moderately successful. Many of Bachchan's films during this early period did not do well. His only film with Mala Sinha, 
                    Sanjog (1972) was also a box office failure</p></div>

                    In 2000, Bachchan hosted the first season of Kaun Banega Crorepati (KBC), the Indian adaptation of the British television 
                    game show, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?. The show was well received. A second season followed in 2005 but its run was cut 
                    short by Star Plus when Bachchan fell ill in 2006. He then returned to host the fourth season, and has hosted the show since.

                   The fifth season started on 15 August 2011 and ended on 17 November 2011. The show became a massive hit with audiences and 
                   broke many TRP Records. CNN IBN awarded Indian of the Year- Entertainment to Team KBC and Bachchan. The Show also grabbed

                  The sixth season was also hosted by Bachchan, commencing on 7 September 2012, broadcast on Sony TV and received the highest 
                  number of viewers thus far.[citation needed] In 2014, he debuted in the fictional Sony Entertainment Television TV series titled 
                  Yudh playing the lead role of a businessman battling both his personal and professional life.

                  In 1984, Bachchan took a break from acting and briefly entered politics in support of a long-time family friend, Rajiv Gandhi. 
                  He contested the Allahabad's (presently Prayagraj Lok Sabha constituency) seat for the 8th Lok Sabha against H. N. Bahuguna, 
                  former Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh. With 68.2% of the votes in his favour, he won by one of the highest victory margins 
                  ever in Indian elections. In 1987, Indian Express said his brother Ajitabh Bachchan owned an apartment in Switzerland, 
                  giving rise to speculations about his involvement in the "Bofors scandal", revealed in the year before. Bachchan resigned 
                  from his seat in July 1987. Ajitabh Bachchan sued Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter for linking him to Bofors payments in 
                  1990 and won damages in the United Kingdom. Sten Lindstrom, the Swedish police chief who had investigated the case, said in 
                  2012 that "Indian investigators planted the Bachchan angle on" Dagens Nyheter.</p></div>
